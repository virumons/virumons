Hii there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Viraj,
As a student at SDMCET, Dharwad, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My experience in learning new skills and developing projects has identified me as a proficient web  developer. As a student, I have gained experience in leading project groups and collaborating with technical individuals to make a positive impact. Over the years, I have learned new technologies and developed small projects, and I am proud of that I have delivered quality projects within the deadline.
On a personal level, I am passionate about collaborating with others and utilizing my known skills to solve problems and develop better solutions. My focus is towards improving myself both professionally and personally. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I always strive to learn new things to enhance my knowledge and skillset. I am confident that my passion for development and my commitment to learning will help me make significant contributions to any team or project I work on.

I am more excited to learn and connect with like-minded individuals to grow collaboratively.

I hope you have a good day ðŸ‘‹
